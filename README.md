# Sorting-Visualizer-Unity

I'm creating a sorting visualizer using Unity.

It's still a work in progress. But it will include multiple sorting methods.


<a href="https://zouheirn.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer-Unity/" target="_blank">Here is a very early look at the project.</a>
Note that the speed multiplier does not currently work on WebGL, will have to look into it later but I'll probably include a build release later.
